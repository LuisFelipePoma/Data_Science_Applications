Environment,"When I was young, we dwelt in a valeBy a misty fen that rang all night, And thus it was the maidens pale I knew so well, whose garments trailAcross the reeds to a window light.The fen had every kind of bloom, "
Environment,"When icicles hang by the wall   And Dick the shepherd blows his nailAnd Tom bears logs into the hall   And milk comes frozen home in pail,When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,Then nightly sings the staring owl,                        Tu-whit;Tu-who, a merry note,While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.When all aloud the wind doth"
Environment,"when life is quite through with and leaves say alas, much is to do for the swallow,that closes a flight in the blue;when love's had his tears out, perhaps shall pass a million years (while a bee dozes on the poppies,the dears;when all's done and said,and under the grass lies her head by oaks and roses deliberated.) "
Environment,"When the bare feet of the baby beat across the grassThe little white feet nod like white flowers in the wind,They poise and run like ripples lapping across the water;And the sight of their white play among the grassIs like a little robin’s song, winsome,Or as two white butterflies settle"
Environment,"Where an ash bush grows in the lakea ring of stones has broken coverin this summer's drought.Not high enough to be an island,it holds a disc of stiller waterin the riffled lake. Trees have reclaimed the railway line behind us;behind that, the road goes"
Environment,"where the sea circles around the island in a star pattern – where in the center of grieving we are disoriented, skinless – where I wade into the field . . . the scent of sun on wheat – where the horses bow in & out, kick up a hoof,"
Environment,"Who would decry instruments— when grasses ever so fragile, provide strings stout enough for insect moods to glide up and down in glissandos of toes along wires or finger-tips on zithers—thoughthe mere soundsbe theirs, not ours—theirs, not ours,the first inspiration—discord"
Environment,"Why make so much of fragmentary blue In here and there a bird, or butterfly, Or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye, When heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?Since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven (as yet)— Though some savants make earth include the sky; And blue so far above us comes so high, It"
Environment,"Woman, I wish I didn't know your name. What could you be? Silence in my house& the front yard where the dogwoodwouldn't make up its mind about flowers.Aren't you Nature? A stem cringing, half- shadowed beneath a torque of rain.I too am leaving. I too am"
Environment,"Yonder to the kiosk, beside the creek, Paddle the swift caque. Thou brawny oarsman with the sunburnt cheek, Quick! for it soothes my heart to hear the Bulbul speak.Ferry me quickly to the Asian shores, Swift bending to your oars. Beneath"
Environment,"You come to fetch me from my work to-night When supper's on the table, and we'll see If I can leave off burying the white Soft petals fallen from the apple tree. (Soft petals, yes, but not so barren quite, Mingled with these, smooth bean and wrinkled pea;) And go along with you ere you lose"
Environment,"You see them through water and glass, (both liquids) and through air with plenty of liquid in it —water is moving through the air— you see the large dolphins animated, unfractious in their nativedrink, going back and forth interacting with some sort of rings—in a minute-long video— in a loop, we see these dolphins again and again looping through"
